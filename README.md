## 🤖 The V7.1 CORE Analysis Engine

The heart of the bot is its advanced technical analysis engine. It moves beyond simple indicator thresholds and uses a weighted scoring system to build a complete analytical picture.

1.  **Pattern & Structure (High Impact):** The engine first identifies high-probability candlestick patterns and their alignment with critical market structure levels. A pattern at a key level receives the highest score.
2.  **Indicator Confluence:** It then checks for confirmation from standard technical indicators like RSI, Stochastics, and the MACD Histogram.
3.  **Contextual Modifiers:** Finally, it applies contextual factors. The score is adjusted based on market sentiment (e.g., reducing confidence in a CALL signal during "Extreme Greed") and upcoming news events.
4.  **Confidence Score:** The final output is a single, actionable **Confidence Score** that represents the engine's conviction in the signal, complete with detailed reasoning.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (via CDN), Custom CSS for animations and futuristic effects
